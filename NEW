Notes for the 5th ACK distribution:

It is not wise to mix files created by the previous version of the Kit
with files belonging to this version, although that might sometimes work.
Many problems with the previous distribution have been fixed.
The major additions are:

	- an ANSI C compiler
	- a LINT C program checker, both non-ansi and ansi
	- an Intel 80386 back-end
	- a SPARC code expander
	- a source level debugger for Pascal, Modula-2, C, and ANSI C
	- an Acorn Archimedes back-end
	- code-expanders for VAX, Intel 80386 and Motorola M68020 processors,
	  and very fast Pascal, Modula-2, ANSI C, and C compilers constructed
	  using these code expanders
	- a cc-compatible very fast C compiler for SUN-3 and VAX.

Also added, but not part of the Kit proper are
	- flex: a lexical analyzer generator
	- byacc: yacc-clone by UCB
	- f2c: a Fortran to C compiler by AT&T.

See the ACK installation manual for their copyright notices.

This version is usually refered to as 5.0.

Notes for update 1 of the 5th ACK distribution:

This is a complete distribution, but does not deserve a new version number,
as the only addition is the support for Solaris 2 on SPARCs. It also contains
many bug fixes.
We refer to this version as 5.1.
