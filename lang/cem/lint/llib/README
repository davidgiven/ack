This directory contains the standard lint libraries.  Normally, nothing
needs to be done here.  The standard library c.llb contains all entries
from termlib, curses and math as well, which provides the user with
advance warnings if he inadvertently uses a global name that is also
used by one of these libraries.

A file with a UNIX 7 view of the system calls is provided, named unix7.c.
If need be it can be updated and merged into c.llb by calling

	make c.llb  (or just make)

If one of the other entries is a shade off, it is unsually easier to edit
c.llb by hand.

Empty files for termlib.llb, curses.llb and m.llb are provided
for compatibility.
