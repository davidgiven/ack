	DESCRIPTION
	This is an independent rewrite of the malloc/free package; it is
	fast and efficient.  Free blocks are kept in doubly linked lists,
	list N holding blocks with sizes between 2**N and 2**(N+1)-1.
	Consequently neither malloc nor free have to do any searching:
	the cost of a call of malloc() (or free()) is constant, however
	many blocks you have got.
	
	If you switch on the NON_STANDARD macro (see param.h) every block
	costs 2 pointers overhead (otherwise it's 4).
*/
/*
	There is an organisational problem here: during devellopment
	I want the package divided into modules, which implies external
	names for the communication.  The only external names I want in
	the finished product are malloc, realloc and free.  This requires
	some hanky-panky.
