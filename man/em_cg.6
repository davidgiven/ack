.SH NAME
em_cg \- EM to assembly code translator
.SH SYNOPSIS
~em/lib.bin/\fImach\fP/cg [-d] [-p\fIn\fP] [-w\fIn\fP] [ infile [ outfile ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Em_cg reads a compact EM-program, argument or standard input,
and produces an assembly program on argument or standard output
for the machine that is in its name.
Flags recognized are:
.IP -d
Run in debugging mode,
only possible when the translator is compiled in the right way.
.IP -p\fIn\fP
Set the ply to \fIn\fP, default 1.
The ply is the maximum lookahead depth the code generator may take.
Effects of this flag are machine dependent.
.IP -w\fIn\fP
Set the weight percentage for size to \fIn\fP %, default is 50.
This sets the size/time tradeoff in the codegenerator.
Effects are again machine dependent.
