iburg -- A Code Generator Generator

iburg is a code-generator generator that uses dynamic programming at
compile time. It's described in

C. W. Fraser, D. R. Hanson and T. A. Proebsting,
Engineering a simple, efficient code generator generator,
ACM Letters on Prog. Languages and Systems 1, 3 (Sep. 1992), 213-226.

iburg is written in and generates ANSI C and thus must be compiled
with an ANSI C compiler and preprocessor, e.g., gcc or lcc. To compile
iburg, type "make". There should be no warnings or errors (except
perhaps in the system-dependent YACC skeleton). If you need to
customize the makefile, edit custom.mk, which is included in makefile.
The default custom.mk is empty.

sample.brg is from the paper in burg.ps, sample4.brg is from the paper
in iburg.ps, and sample5.brg is an example from a compilers course.
"make test" runs iburg on sample[45].brg and executes the resulting
programs. The output should be something like:

% make test
./iburg -I sample4.brg sample4.c; cc -o test4 sample4.c; ./test4
sample4.c
i = c + 4;
stmt: ASGNI(disp,reg)
 disp: ADDRLP
 reg: disp
  disp: ADDI(reg,con)
   reg: CVCI(INDIRC(disp))
    disp: ADDRLP
   con: CNSTI
./iburg -I sample5.brg sample5.c; cc -o test5 sample5.c; ./test5
sample5.c
stm: MOVE(MEM(loc),reg)
 loc: NAME
 reg: PLUS(MEM(loc),reg)
  loc: PLUS(NAME,reg)
   reg: MEM(loc)
    loc: NAME
  reg: con
   con: CONST
%

To install iburg, copy it and its man page to the appropriate local
directories, e.g., on UNIX:

% cp iburg /usr/local
% cp iburg.1 /usr/local/man/man1

"make clobber" removes the executables and all derived files except
gram.c; "make clean" removes just object, core, and sample*.c files.

Mail bug reports along with the shortest input that exposes them to
