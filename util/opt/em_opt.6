.SH NAME
em_opt \- EM peephole optimizer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ~em/lib/em_opt
[-Ln] [ argument ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Em_opt reads a compact EM-program, argument or standard input,
and produces another compact EM program on standard output
that is functionally equivalent,
but smaller.
Some other functions are here that make this program mandatory
before running a codegenerator,
it may be left out when interpretation is wanted.
Flags recognized are:
.IP -L
Make a library module.
This means that the output will start with a message giving
the names of all exported entities in this module.
.IP -n
Do not optimize.
No peephole optimizations will be performed,
other functions will be carried out.
.SH "FILES"
/usr/tmp/emopt??????, is used when the -L flag is given only.
